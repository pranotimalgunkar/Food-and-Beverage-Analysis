# Food-and-Beverage-Analysis
🌟 Introduction:
Hello everyone! I'm Pranoti, I have participated in the Code Basics Resume Project Challenge. I worked on an exciting marketing project for CodeX, a well-known German beverage company entering the Indian market. I analyzed survey responses for their recently launched energy drink in 10 cities.

🌟 Task:
My role was to analyze survey data from 10,000 participants and extract meaningful insights. This helped CodeX make informed marketing decisions, increase brand awareness, and enhance product development.

🌟 Approach:
I utilized  SQL Server for conducting Query, Power BI for visual analysis, and PPT for engaging  visual presentations. With these tools, I discovered key findings to drive our future actions.

🌟 Key Findings:
1. Demographics & Consumer Behavior
•	60% of CodeX’s customers are male, indicating a strong male consumer base.
•	The 19–30 age group shows the highest preference for energy drinks.
•	56% of respondents are young people, presenting a strong opportunity to engage the youth segment.
•	Increased energy and improved focus are the primary reasons for consuming energy drinks.
2. Marketing & Brand Positioning
•	Online advertising is the most effective and cost-efficient channel, especially for reaching the youth (15–30 years).
•	Brand reputation is the main reason consumers prefer competitor brands (e.g., Cola-Coka, the current market leader) over CodeX.
•	There is a need to increase marketing focus in Tier-2 cities to capture untapped potential.
3. Product Preferences
•	Consumers prefer energy drinks with caffeine and natural ingredients.
•	Compact and portable cans are the most preferred packaging format.
•	The majority of respondents expressed little interest in limited-edition packaging.
•	Consumers increasingly desire healthier options, such as reduced sugar and natural ingredients.
4. Purchasing Behavior
•	45% of consumers prefer buying energy drinks from supermarkets, while 25% prefer online channels.
•	The most preferred price range is ₹50–₹150, making it an important consideration for competitive pricing.

🌟 Actionable Recommendations:
1. Collaborate with online influencers to improve online ad campaigns and expand reach.
2. Enhance the product with natural alternatives. 
3. Content-based pricing to meet varied customer needs Tiered pricing increases accessibility and supports wider market reach.
4. Recommend offering both packaging options initially and monitoring consumer preferences over time to scale up production for the more popular format.
5. Strengthen partnerships with local supermarkets for increased visibility and availability.

🌟 Suggestions for Brand Enhancement:
1. Enhance natural caffeine content and promote mental alertness by incorporating green tea extract and Guarana.
2.To reduce sugar content, introduce Stevia and Monk Fruit, natural zero-calorie sweeteners that provide sweetness without raising blood sugar levels.
3. Consider Virat Kohli OR Sunil Chhetri as a brand ambassador to leverage his appeal among the youth and fitness enthusiasts.
